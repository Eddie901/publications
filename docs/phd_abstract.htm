            <h2>Default Reasoning Using Maximum Entropy and Variable Strength 
              Defaults </h2>
            <p> The thesis presents a computational model for reasoning with partial 
              information which uses default rules or information about what normally 
              happens. The idea is to provide a means of filling the gaps in an 
              incomplete world view with the most plausible assumptions while 
              allowing for the retraction of conclusions should they subsequently 
              turn out to be incorrect. The model can be used both to reason from 
              a given knowledge base of default rules, and to aid in the construction 
              of such knowledge bases by allowing their designer to compare the 
              consequences of his design with his own default assumptions. The 
              conclusions supported by the proposed model are justified by the 
              use of a probabilistic semantics for default rules in conjunction 
              with the application of a rational means of inference from incomplete 
              knowledge---the principle of maximum entropy (ME). </p>
            <p>The thesis develops both the theory and algorithms for the ME approach 
              and argues that it should be considered as a general theory of default 
              reasoning. The argument supporting the thesis has two main threads. 
              Firstly, the ME approach is tested on the benchmark examples required 
              of nonmonotonic behaviour, and it is found to handle them appropriately. 
              Moreover, these patterns of commonsense reasoning emerge as consequences 
              of the chosen semantics rather than being design features. It is 
              argued that this makes the ME approach more objective, and its conclusions 
              more justifiable, than other default systems. Secondly, the ME approach 
              is compared with two existing systems: the lexicographic approach 
              (LEX) and system Z+. It is shown that the former can be equated 
              with ME under suitable conditions making it strictly less expressive, 
              while the latter is too crude to perform the subtle resolution of 
              default conflict which the ME approach allows. Finally, a program 
              called DRS is described which implements all systems discussed in 
              the thesis and provides a tool for testing their behaviours.</p>
